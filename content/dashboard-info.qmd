This is the dashboard page. It includes an HTML snippet (and loads in custom javascript) in order to provide the dashboard below. While this is a fully functional version of the dashboard, presentation like this (in a frame within a website) might be restrictive and make it more difficult to use, so there is also a provided link to go full-size.

At the moment, both the embedded version and the full screen version are two separate, fully-functional replicated apps to ensure they work nicely in both formats; however as we develop the app this may become tedious and we might instead implement conditional styling that updates depending on whether you are looking at the content full-screen or not.

Alternatively, if the homepage of the webapp is a text-based page that describes the use of the app, we might not have to keep this "framing page" at all, and instead the "Dashboard" link directly launches the full-screen version. We just need to keep in mind that the user needs some context and direction before being thrown in at the deep-end with the tool.

## Logistical details

At the top of this page, the leaflet css stylesheet is loaded. We can include a note for this in the cookies banner, or load it locally. Currently, it is loaded locally.

## Embedded dashboard

Note - the fullscreen version linked below currently isn't correctly pulling through data because of the directory structure - on the list to fix!
