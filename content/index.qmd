title: "Landing page"
---

This is the home page of the website, written in markdown. You might want to embed the dashboard here directly, or just have an information screen if you don't want to overwhelm users.

For this example, I've kept this page minimal and have added a button below to view the webapp (or you can use the navbar at the top).

Of course, this can be made more colourful and friendly, with the addition of images, illustrations, etc.
