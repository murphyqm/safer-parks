# Safer Parks Project
Work on the Safer Parks project.

This repository contains the source code for a tempalte web-app to be used for the Safer Parks project. This web-app is still a work-in-progress/draft. You can see the prototyping behind-the-scenes over at my [Static App Experimentation repo](https://github.com/murphyqm/static-app-experiments).

## Requirements (from a purely technical standpoint):

- Open, open-source
- Static framework that doesn't require a server - as cheap as possible
- Extensible
  - While we are focusing on a specific location, the tool sould be useable for other geographic regions.
