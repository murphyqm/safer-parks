While this is a fully functional version of the dashboard, presentation like this (in a frame within a website) might be restrictive and make it more difficult to use, so there is also a provided link to go full-size.\nAt the moment, both the embedded version and the full screen version are two separate, fully-functional replicated apps to ensure they work nicely in both formats; however as we develop the app this may become tedious and we might instead implement conditional styling that updates depending on whether you are looking at the content full-screen or not.\nAlternatively, if the homepage of the webapp is a text-based page that describes the use of the app, we might not have to keep this ‚Äúframing page‚Äù at all, and instead the ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù link directly launches the full-screen version. We just need to keep in mind that the user needs some context and direction before being thrown in at the deep-end with the tool."
